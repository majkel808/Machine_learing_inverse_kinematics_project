# MACHINE LEARNING INVERSE KINEMATICS PROJECT

## Overview
The project is written in Python and aims to determine the motion of a 3R robot using a neural network model. Inverse kinematics were developed through linear regression based on the TensorFlow library. The remaining scripts were used to develop forward kinematics and robot motion trajectories.

## Detiled description
The aim of the project was to gain a better understanding of the principles of describing robot kinematics and their mathematical representation, enabling the determination of the end effector position of the robot arm and subsequently its inverse kinematics.

The stages of the project were:

- Development of the forward kinematics model for the 3R robotic arm.
- Creation of an application allowing for the control of the robot arm's position using sliders.
- Script creation to generate datasets for machine learning purposes.
- Implementation of a linear regression neural network model.
- Writing a script to generate trajectories for the XYZ position of the end effector and feeding them into the model.
- Utilizing predicted angular positions of the robotic joints to animate the robot's movement.
- 
## Project Structure
Under the directory named "whole_project," you will find all the necessary files to execute the linear regression model, as well as all the scripts required to animate the movement of the robot.

In the remaining folders, files are grouped for easy organization.
