# Machine_learing_inverse_kinematics_project
The project is written in Python and aims to determine the motion of a 3R robot using a neural network model. Inverse kinematics were developed through linear regression based on the TensorFlow library. The remaining scripts were used to develop forward kinematics and robot motion trajectories.
